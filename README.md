An easy to use productivity application that allows the user to set up a family account.  The user can create todo lists for each family member and send their lists to them via email or sms message. This app is designed to keep the whole family up-to-date and staying productive. 

Motivation for the project: To fill in a need in this scene to create a website that is specific to the rock / alternative genre. To get people together locally to find locally to find smaller and bigger artists.

Design Process / Functionailty: We would take three imputs / buttons that have drop down menues that have genre, distance and date. We are going to use that information to return informaton using different api's and return relevant information based off the users imput. We are going to use materialize, javascript and css to design the app.

Future Deveopment:

git clone https://github.com/sbc1133/Battelist.git
