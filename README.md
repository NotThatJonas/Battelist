**Project Intro:** 

An easy to use productivity application that allows the user to set up a family account.  The user can create todo lists for each family member and send their lists to them via email or sms message. This app is designed to keep the whole family up-to-date and staying productive. 

**Design Process / Functionailty:**   
1.User adds a task through a click of a SHARE button and a drop down menu will let user select which family member that task belongs to. The task is then added under the family members name.  After all the tasks are 


that have drop down menues that have genre, distance and date. We are going to use that information to return informaton using different api's and return relevant information based off the users input. We are going to use mdbootstrap, javascript, jQuery and css to design the app.

**Future Deveopment:**  
* Alexa integration: voice creates task list  
* Randomizer: Allows user to use randomly choose a member of the household for the assigned tasks (works well for kids and adults too!)  * Ability to upload a profile picture for each member   
* Adding a reminder for user and/or members  
* Encouragement quotes that can be sent to members when a task is added  
* Gamify the app - setup a point system which the user can give a reward of their choosing when the member reaches their goal.
